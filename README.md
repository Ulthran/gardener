# gardener

This project automates watering of our plants using a PyBoard and a set of
small pumps. The initial goal is to reliably keep a few houseplants happy, but
the framework is flexible enough to grow into other automation tasks as well.

The core code lives in the `waterer` directory and is meant to run under
MicroPython on the board.
